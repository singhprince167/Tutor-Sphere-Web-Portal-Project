# Tutor-Sphere-Web-Portal-Project
As part of the MCA curriculum, I developed Tutor Sphere, a dynamic web portal designed to connect tutors and students efficiently.
Problem Statement: 
Physically searching for a tutor or mentor can be time-consuming and may not yield the desired 
results. When searching for a tutor or mentor in person, it can be difficult to verify the 
qualifications and background of the individual, increasing the risk of working with someone 
who is not qualified or trustworthy. Physically searching for a tutor or mentor can be 
inconvenient, especially for busy individuals who have limited time to devote to the search 
process.
To resolve these kinds of problems we are going to develop a web portal which is a solution of 
above-mentioned problems.
